## Using GitHub Only (Web Interface)

### Create an Account

Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and sign up for a free account or click on <kbd>**Continue with Google**</kbd> to sign up using Google login.

 Follow the prompts to create your personal account.


During sign up, you'll be asked to verify your email address.

 Without a verified email address, you won't be able to use all GitHub features.
